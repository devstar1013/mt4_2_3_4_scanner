Meaning that when 1 crosses say the 1m - 50 ema - the other 2 will follow. And when 2 out of the 3 cross the 50 ema then the 3rd one will definitely follow and cross its 50 ema.

The 50 ema is not what I use-its just for an example.

But you do you get the over all concept of what Im looking for?

Here is what happens in order - this will be a buy example.

1. All 3 symbols all start under the 50 ema.
This is the trigger so to speak. When the ea sees that all three are under the 50 ema it starts to look for 1 of the 3 to go up and touch its 50 ema.

2. Once the symbol -say eurusd for this example hits its 50 ema the ea will pop up an arrow saying that eurusd has hit its 50 -so maybe show an arrow there and an X on both cadchf AND nzdusd to show they have not hit their 50 ema.

3. Then once eurusd hits its 50 ema the scanner waits until the next symbol hits its 50 - for example it waits until cadchf hits 50 ema. Once the cadchf hits its 50 ema the ea will another arrow pop up showing it had hit it.

So now there will be 2 up arrows and only one X still - the X will be nzdusd because it will be the only one that hasnt touched its 50 ema yet.

4. Then if nzdusd ends up hitting its 50 ema eventually the scanner is done.

The scanner is done until all 3 symbols are either over or under their 50 emas - then it will start the process again.
